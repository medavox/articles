don't give up and get a job, because your physical best years are now 
enjoy them as much as you can (especially with diabetes), because you won't be able to do it when you're 50  
fuck boring shit  
fuck mortgages  
bank accounts  
loans  

do it your own way  
discover happiness  
happiness does not preclude productivity  
write your own story and fuck what you 'should' do.  
get a real job, not some dead-end office shit  


Be:-

boring but practical/simple yet awesome
LIVE your principles
substance over style
Knight in Sour Armor
