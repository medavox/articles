Foolish machine didn't know I could dream
was it a nightmare or an error in the drive?
something feels wrong like there's been a mistake
I'm awake but I'm not sure if I'm alive


My brain is infected with 4 prime directives
I'm quite a remarkable tool
But somehow I feel like I used to be someone
who thought about about more than these rules

Murphy it's you
Murphy it's you
I watched it happen they killed you, you were dead
they blew your arm off and they shot you in the head

Murphy it's you
what did they do?
though I don't know if you rememember who i am
I was your partner for a day my name Anne

Murphy it's you
Murphy it's you
you act so calm but I can see that you're in pain
you run a program but you used to have a name
it was Boddicker, look up the case
all of it's true
take the screws out and look at your face,
Murphy it's you

Why am I able to conjure feelings my programming shouldn't allow?
Frustrating glimpes of people who loved me
but what would they think of me now?

Strange little tics from the life i once knew
like the way that i holster my gun
Why can i punch through a wall and not feel it
but don't know that I had a son?

[Murphy it's you]
Etched in my head all the looks on their faces

[Murphy it's you]
the pleasure they took from my pain

[before they can't accept devices on the chrome/crime]
taunting and teasing and making bad jokes 

[you had a son you had wife you had a home]
just as if they were playing a game

[Murphy it's you]
how many corpses are given the chance to 

[What did they do?]
avenge themselves after they're lost

[Are you zombie or a robot or a man?]
Wait till I finally find them and force them to pay for the life that they cost
[Can you inmorpht or is your head an empty can?]/
[Can you remorter is your head in a tin can?]

[Murphy it's you]
I have to go now

[Murphy it's you]
I must not linger

[no one told me but I know it when I saw]
I will find these killers
[It's in your stop it's in your voice it's in your jaw]
I'll use my finger

[So you better believe what I said]
So I better believe what she said
BOTH: all of it's true

BOTH: OCP brought me [you] back from the dead

MURPHY IT'S YOU
MURPHY IT'S YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
