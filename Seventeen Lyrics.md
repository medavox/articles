Music & Lyrics by Sian Hill

(c) Sian Hill 2013.

```
I cant forget the way she looked when she was 17
she was full of grace and poise just like a beauty queen

PRE
she never wanted to dance 
dance with me

we were too busy constructing ways to destroy each other

CHORUS
Help
I think I'm falling apart
seventeen
seventeen

Help
I think I'm falling apart
seventeen
seventeen
[/chorus]

So give me a kiss with your sing song lips
let me sink my teeth into your summerskin

I see through that mask of yours it's ripped and paper thin

I was young and bleak
in love with the flesh

obsessed with myself and
sore to death

PRE
you were beautiful
always beautiful

you stuck the knife right in
you don't know the pain you left me in

CHORUS
Help
I think I'm falling apart
seventeen
seventeen

Help
I think I'm falling apart
seventeen
seventeen

Never knew the end would feel like this
can't believe how love marked my skin

i see thru that mask of yours it's ripped and paper thin

CHORUS
Help
I think I'm falling apart
seventeen
seventeen

Help
I think I'm falling apart
seventeen
seventeen
```
