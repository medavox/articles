jean-luc picard is descended from expat brits in france

-------------------------------------------

perhaps the UK conquered or otherwise replaced the French language
between now and the era of TNG

----------------------------------

Perhaps the Picards were Huguenots who fled France after the revocation of the Edict Of Nantes in 1685, 
settled in England, and gradually become English.

Then, at some point over the next seven centuries, 
some of them moved back to France.

That would help explain the Captain's fondness for Shakespeare, 
along with his family's English-accented English, 
and the fact that he considers it noteworthy that one of his ancestors fought at Trafalgar.

----------------------

I suppose it is possible that Picards ancestor was an expatriate French Nobleman, 
who would rather fight along side the Brits than visit the guillotine. 
Once Napoleon was defeated this Picard returned to France. 

------------------------

Patrick Stewart once joked that Picard had a British nanny. 

---------------------------

I used to live in Spain, 
and I knew many Spanish people and French people who spoke flawless English with a British accent. 
Presumably the teaching techniques in the future are far superior to today,
 and Picard obviously took advantage of those techniques whereas his brother apparently did not.

 ------------------------

  I watched any interview with Patrick Stewart some time ago in which the question of the accent was addressed. 
  His explanation was that, unlike many of his fellow Frenchmen, he learned how to speak English right. 

  ---------------------

   
  Well considering Picard's whole family have the same accent, 
  I can only conclude that in WWIII we conquered France and stole all their vineyards. ;)
