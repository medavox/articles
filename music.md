Most recent entries first.

December 2018
=============

Young Scum
----------

Delicious indie pop with that Decemberists New England Aesthete autotune voice.
So good!

Jazz, and maybe some Funk
----

* John Coltrane
* Herbie Hancock

Yeah jazz!

November 2018
=============

Realising some of my Joy Division tastes actually encroach into full Goth territory,
I decided to jump down the rabbit hole with both legs (?) and try the really 'gothy' stuff.

This appears to be called 'Darkwave'.

Bands include:-

* Molly Nilssen
* The Frozenv Autumn
* Pleasure Symbols

I also have been listening to Psychedelic Rock, including:

* King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard
    - (and their million or so recorded albums)
* The Re-Stoned
* My Sleeping Karma


October 2018
===========

Radio 1 Ibiza Prom
-------

a brilliantly-performed collection of 'safe' BBC-friendly dance classics - fat boy slim etc

YouTube User Vincent MT - Composition No 3
-----

Molly Nilsgren - new wave super retro 80s, but in that obviously very current way.
Most active in 2015, so maybe a bit of a trendsetter? (or maybe I just missed the start)

half.alive
---------

super-polished, super-slick, super-commercialised electronic pop-funk.

You can practically feel the california ideology and apple products sublimating off them.

haha "looks like an urban outfitters commercial"

Grauzone
-------

Short-lived 80s German New Wave band. Sound (to me) very similar to Joy Division.

Anne Clark
---------

80s spoken-word British techno artist popular in Germany,
who sounds about 10 years ahead of her time.

Peter Schilling
-------------

The commercialised side of the 80s German New Wave. Good Song: Major Tom ist Vollig Losgelöst
(Also the theme song to Deutschland '83)

The Soft Moon
-----------

Another continuation of that Joy Division sound. First album really good,
second experiments with noise a bit too much for me

Tei Shi
------

Similar-ish, sound to Grimes, but tamer. Consciously uses sex as a self-promotion tool.
Resultingly, I'm not sure about her yet.

Scratch that, she's a bit like HAIM.Or maybe that's just her KEXP performance.

Plus, she's no more sexed-up than the lead singer of CHVRCHES. She can't help being attractive.

Gülden Karaböcek
---------------

Who had that one 70s Turkish disco hit.
Turns out the rest of her career is similar to that!

Chromatics
---------

More hyper-80s New Wave (Old Wave?)


September 2018

Mariya Takeuchi
--------------

Song: Plastic Love

Drinks
-----

Experimental (from the standpoint of music theory) duo.
Best song - real outside

Cate le Bon
----------

Brilliantly Welsh singing voice. British solo artist,
who's been floating around for about 10 years now.

artist with a unique feel.
Best song: Are you with me now

Courtney Barnett
--------------

Deadpan lyricist who is musically doing the typical 2010s thing of grunge/late 60s early 70s rock.
Best song: Pedestrian at Best, whose video is also brilliant

Chillwave, Synthwave, Serious Vaporwave, Whatever
--------------------------------------------

You can tell its popularity vogueness because of the million names it has.

That purple-pink=blue neon hyper-synth-80s stuff, with computer grids and Lamborghinis. But music.

Turkish 70s disco mixes
---------------------

Especially one song, Nem Kaldı by Gülden Karaböcek 

Mansun
------

Classic 90s rock band from Chester. Sound a bit like Manic Street Preachers, but rockier.

Jake Chudnow

Mind Expanding synthy electronic scores to Vsauce videos. Really frigging good!

Schlägernächte
-------------

German Summer festivals for cheesy oom-pah modern folk music. Hours of guilty pleasures.
Music to drink beer and bop to!

Ancient Tribal Nordic

Here are some of the other bands in what is now another genre I don't knwo the proper name of:

* Heilung
* Forndom
* Danheim
* leidungr 
    - (these might be neo nazis, judging from their imagery.
      There's always one that ruins it for everyone else)


Altın Gün
---------

70s Turkish disco rock revival. As awesome as it sounds.

Khruangbin
---------

Apparently Thai-inspired (I don't think so, having listened to their cited influence)
very 3-piece 60s surf rock. Super chill, rather sexy

Childish Gambino
----------------

It's the good Donald!

Mr. Glover's thought-provoking and often neurotic rap. Watch him grow up through his career!
Political, but only because it's political to be young, gifted and Black in Americca

* Early Destiny's Child - Bills, Bills, Bills
* Kelly Rowland - Stole

Lauryn Hill
---------

Album - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill

Beldina
-------

Swedish R&B with that classic "Angels With Dirty Faces"-era Sugababes sound.

Luísa Sobral

Sophisticated jazz, mostly in Portuguese. She wrote the 2017 winning Eurovision song with her brother,

August 2017
=======

Spencer Davis Group - Gimme Some Lovin'
-----------

That awesome driving grooving song from the Blues Brothers.

The band (Spencer Davis Group) is actually a bit of a forgotten pride of Britain. More awesome music!

Another song: Keep on Running (you'll recognise it!)


July 2017
=========

Investigating the Careers of the Members of Hot Freaks, before and after it
--------

* Vicious vicious - ho baby
* SPEARZ - joke britney cover band by (i think) 2 of the members
* Night Moves - 60s/70s rock/soul. May contain Hot Freaks' guitarist.
    - similar to Tame Impala imho
    - Their song 'Colored Emotions' is a smasher.


Ryuichi Sakamoto (Trio?)
--------

He also wrote 'Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence'

### Song: Rain

Oh my god, when I relistened to this just now (30 October 2018) it went straight to my soul.

Contemporary japanese, mostly classical instruments. May be from a JRPG.

Full of feeling.

June 2017
========

listened to  old favourites:
* Hello Seahorse!
* Smooth McGroove
* Hot Freaks

Checked out Brand New. I can't remember their sound now (30 October 2018),
so they can't have made that much of an impression.

Giles Corey
--------

Depressing postrock about suicide, as far as I can tell.

May 2017
======

(What little time I wasn't still listening to and investigating RHCP's hidden gems):

Invesigated 19th century propaganda music & national anthems:

* Land of Hope and Glory
* God Save The Tsar!
* Coronation Anthem - Zadok The Priest

April 2017
=========

Discovered an entire album's worth of songs from RHCP's BTW recording sessions.
Such a gift. Truly made my month. No, 3 months.

After discovering this, also found that there is a fan remaster of californication,
which sounds a lot better than the clipped shit on the CD.

Couple that with a tracklist amendment by me, and I've basically
had a 2-album drop of new Red Hot Chili Peppers songs from (what is for me) their golden age.

YUSSSSSSS

Musically, this (nearly) occupied the rest of the month, along with searching for good songs
from other recording sessions, and checking an obscure wiki for lists of unpublished songs.

Radiohead
---------

### Album: Moon Shaped Pool

Discovering new shit from **my** version of the RHCP, I decided to go looking for other unheard stuff
from my favourite bands. Discovered this album from Radiohead.



The end song from the film, "The Tale of Princess Kaguya"

March 2017
=========

(Still listening to Wardruna, Porter Robinson)

silly shit
--------

* Tongo - Chop Suey
* CEREAL FOR HUMAN
* Don't stomp by youtube user PilotRedSun


Classical Stuff
--------------

* Profokiev - dance of the Knights
* Bizet - Carmen
* Offenbach  - Can Can



February 2017
============

Porter Robinson
---------

Synth electronic artist with that chill GTA5 sound.
Rather chiptuney too. So very good.

Just noticedone song has an Anamanaguchi remix, so definitely chiptune-related.

Later turned out a LOT of his sound might have come from the songs (and more generally the genre) he 'sampled'
(namely, 80s japanese pop).

Madeon
------

The suggestions include M83, which I think is appropriate for both this and Porter Robinson.

Seem to be part of the crest of a wave of great synth which earlier included M83.

Vanilla
------

Esp. album 'Origin'.

More of that chill synth stuff.

It's got those panpipes in it that make it sound like an actual one of those hippie chillout tapes
(that your mum and dad played on long holiday drives & days out in the Sierra)

Deru
----

Sad slow synth songs. Reminds me of Lavender Town and UNKLE. But more ambient. Desolate.

--------

Songs from the Les Misérables Musical
-----------------------------

* Do you hear the people sing
* Red & Black

Songs from Steven Universe
-------------------------

* It's over (isn't it)
* love me like you

------

Third Eye Blind - Can I Graduate
----------

Exposed to by the Guitar Hero games, but this one song of theirs paints this
story of a vulnerable young man trying to get his life back together.

Buttering Trio
------------

Smooth Israeli funk/jazz/new wave/trip-ho

KerenDun
-------

More trip hoppy stuff. Probably from related videos to Buttering Trio.

Loses points for teasing nudity as virality booster in video.

Play Dead
---------

80s subculture rock band: "played alongside contemporaries such as Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,
Killing Joke and the Chameleons,
but sadly never quite managed the same levels of success as them".

also PlayDead
-----------

on bandcamp! https://pladead.bandcamp.com/ - synths n shit

Sounds a bit like a clever fuckboy imitating radiohead's experimental electronic side.


January 2017
============

Coccolino Deep
-------------

Chillwave (I think?) DJ mixing some seriously trance-inducing, relaxingly rhythmically music into
into hour-long YouTube videos themed to a film.


December 2016
===========

Wardruna
-------

Tribal Nordic (apparently metal?) wardrum-heavy ancient vibes

Exist Strategy
----------

Post-Rock, I think. Found it in the archives.

Chicago - 25 or 6 to 4
----------------------

An old favourite song of mine.


November 2016
============

Bill Wurtz
---------

Super-weird Youtuber who also makes super-technical jazz-funk-fusion (in the japanese style)
with nonsense lyrics

The Police
----------

Comparing their live performances in 1983 and a reunion tour in 2008

Faun
-----

German metal-looking celtic-folk.

Maybe a bit socially conservative,
but I can't understand the german well enough to tell just how much they want women back in the kitchen. 

So it's fine??


October 2016
===========

Rolemusic
--------

8 bit and chiptune. Good song: 'Enthalpy'

Godspeed You! Black Emperor
-----------------------

Classic Post-Rock


Procol Harum - A Whiter Shade of Pale
---------

Absolute. Classic.


Schlager
-------

German music; sort of a cross between knees-up folk songs and whatever genre Steps is. Eurodance?

Music to spill beer to.

Artists include:

* Beatrice Egli (Mein Herz es brennt)
* Gina - (Zwillingstern)
* Vanessa Mai (Ich sterb für dich)
* Andreas Gabalier (I sing a Liad für Di) (swiss german or something)

Spanish-language indie band from Mexico; started off doing toy-folk twee-indie in English,
found its sound (which includes synthesizers), then gets gradually more orchestral throughout their career
