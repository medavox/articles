Music I'm into
============

Retroactively compiled in October 2018.

Most recent entries first.


October 2018
===========

Grauzone
-------

Short-lived 80s German New Wave band. Sound (to me) very similar to Joy Division.

Anne Clark
---------

80s spoken-word British techno artist popular in Germany,
who sounds about 10 years ahead of her time.

Peter Schilling
-------------

The commercialised side of the 80s German New Wave. Good Song: Major Tom ist Vollig Losgelöst
(Also the theme song to Deutschland '83)

The Soft Moon
-----------

Another continuation of that Joy Division sound. First album really good,
second experiments with noise a bit too much for me

Tei Shi
------

Similar-ish, sound to Grimes, but tamer. Consciously uses sex as a self-promotion tool.
Resultingly, I'm not sure about her yet.

Scratch that, she's a bit like HAIM.Or maybe that's just her KEXP performance.

Plus, she's no more sexed-up than the lead singer of CHVRCHES. She can't help being attractive.

Gülden Karaböcek
---------------

Who had that one 70s Turkish disco hit.
Turns out the rest of her career is similar to that!

Chromatics
---------

More hyper-80s New Wave (Old Wave?)

Drinks
-----

Experimental (from the standpoint of music theory) duo.
Best song - real outside

----------

Brilliantly Welsh singing voice. British solo artist,
who's been floating around for about 10 years now.

artist with a unique feel.
Best song: Are you with me now

Courtney Barnett
--------------

Deadpan lyricist who is musically doing the typical 2010s thing of grunge/late 60s early 70s rock.
Best song: Pedestrian at Best, whose video is also brilliant

Chillwave, Synthwave, Serious Vaporwave, Whatever
--------------------------------------------

You can tell its popularity vogueness because of the million names it has.

That purple-pink=blue neon hyper-synth-80s stuff, with computer grids and Lamborghinis. But music.

Turkish 70s disco mixes
---------------------

Especially one song, Nem Kaldı by Gülden Karaböcek 

Mansun
------

Classic 90s rock band from Chester. Sound a bit like Manic Street Preachers, but rockier.

Schlägernächte

German Summer festivals for cheesy oom-pah modern folk music. Hours of guilty pleasures.

Here are some of the other bands in what is now another genre I don't knwo the proper name of:

* Heilung

      There's always one that ruins it for everyone else)


Altın Gün
---------

70s Turkish disco rock revival. As awesome as it sounds.

Khruangbin

Apparently Thai-inspired (I don't think so, having listened to their cited influence)
very 3-piece 60s surf rock. Super chill, rather sexy

Childish Gambino
----------------

It's the good Donald!

Mr. Glover's thought-provoking and often neurotic rap. Watch him grow up through his career!
Political, but only because it's political to be young, gifted and Black in Americca

* Kelly Rowland - Stole

Lauryn Hill
---------

Album - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill
