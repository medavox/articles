Music I'm into
============

Retroactively compiled in October 2018.

Most recent entries first.

Any weeks without entries, I've probably been listening to old stuff.

August 2020

### Danielle Knibbe


More wholesome bluegrassiness. Sounds so fucking good. 

Best song: her cover of The Best, in a unique style (apparently derived from another cover, but imho different enough to be its own style)

Early-mid
---------

A lot of female singers from the Voice France, for some reason.


July 2020
========

Mas Que Nada ("oohhhhhhhh, badiyaaaaaaaaa. oh ba, oh ba, oh ba")

Keleketla!
---------

Brilliant international electronic/afrobeat collaboration. Got a is apparently <genre>m, so have been liatening around that genre a lot as well

June 2020
========

Mid
----

### Julia Holter

Very like Julee Cruise, in that it's a formless nebula of feminine vocals and slow movements.
Discovered through a collab version of Anna Calvi's Swimming Pool (the Hunted Version) played on Radio 6.

Early
----

### Gwilym Bowen Rhys

Welsh-language folk artist. The album Arenig is really sweet music, rally good bluegrassy folk.
Leans a bit too heavily into unaccompanied singing for my taste, 
especially since I can't really understand the lyrics (yet?).

But creates a wonderful atmosphere of wistfully harking back to a simpler time etc.

### Andrew Applepie

Just some good, vanilla instrumental electronic music to study / relax to, lol.

Heard it in a Mark Rober video.

May 2020
=======

Late
---

### Elaine Walker

Uses unconventional note systems (particularly Bohlen-Pierce), but, like Sevish, makes them sound good. Actually gets some conventional instruments to play in that system with her! awesome.


Early-Mid
------

### Gregory Alan Isakov

Really, REALLY sooothing bluegrass folk. Russian-sounding name, very American-sounding music.


April 2020
=========

Late
----

#### Dirty Projectors

Also heard on Radio 6. Really rich, trippy orchestral sound. Feels like the high-budget interludes between the "real" songs on Muse's Absolution album.

March 2020
=========

Late
---

### Jockstrap

Heard on Radio 6. 

Mid
----

### DakhaBrakha


Ukrainian Folk/Classical/Trance quartet. As bonkers as it sounds, but really catchy and danceable.

January 2020
===========

Early
----

### Lightning Bolt

That crazy, intense bass-and-drums duo from that Muse giveaway selection from Kerrang years ago.
the song from that is called magic mountain, which, like most of their stuff,
is incredibly intense and weird.

I prefer their entirely instrumental stuff; 
or at least when the mouth makes no meaning.

I don't want to have to decipher the screaming into words.

They're like a more outsider-art version of Thee Oh Sees

Late
----

### Vangelis - Conquest of Paradise

Ominous last-millenium european expansion and invasion.
Cheesily epic. Humming Choirs.

I think I first heard it in FMA

### Jonathan Bree

incredibly weirdhip new zealander. 
Been going for forever, but was recently recommend-bombed by Youtube's algo, 
so will probably be really popular right now.

Also related: Princess Chelsea - even weirder, often duets with him,
very interesting musicvideo artist basically

### Future Islands

British-sounding singer with that early-80s synth-indie sound
Great lyrics in the song 'Balance'

December 2019
=======

New Favourite Christmas Carol: In The Bleak Midwinter
--------

Its sadness, its "acknowledgment of the bittersweet nature of Christmas,
the memory of all the people you can no longer celebrate it with"
(paraphrased from a BBC documentary about carols with Lucy Worsley),
speaks to me right now.

Gyorgy Ligeti
------------

Terrifying, dense choral arrangements of mostly existential horror.
Soundtrack from 2001: a space oddyssey

Jacob Collier
------------

BBC Home-Counties darling who I heard about quite late.
Straddles the youtube-heartthrob and the modern classical worlds,
by being a rather talented dab hand with the old Harmoniser
(creates acapella on the fly from his voice, presumably controlled by keyboard)

I'm not as keen on him as everyone else apparently is,
but he is still a bloody good musician.

November 2019
=========

Mxmtoon
------

Incredibly now, radio-friendly Steven Universe-sounding Uke+singer.

Best song: Feelings are Fatal

Allie X
------

Opened for Marina at the Apollo.

Best song: Girl of the Year


October 2019
===========

Generally, slightly lesser-known 80s and early 90s pop hits.

The Waterboys - Whole of the Moon
--------

No More I Love Yous
-----

Both the version by Annie Lennox, 
and the lesser-known original by The Lover Speaks

September 2019
=============

Ocean Colour Scene - The Day We Caught The Train
--------

A song everyone knows the chorus to,
but not the name, because the chorus's lyrics are literally "oh oh la la"

The Barry Sisters - Di Grine Kuzine
------------

50s-60s close-harmony pop from a sister trio, but it's in Yiddish.

Also a fun extreme translation challenge.

August 2019
=======

### Early

Finally, finally FINALLY logged back into my old YouTube - 
the one that predates the split between YouTube users and channels.

Rediscovered (what's left of) my old music bookmarks.

My old tastes largely fall into one of three categories:

1. The artist released no more content, or gave up at some point between 2011 and now
2. I'm still listening to them today, or remained aware of them for a while afterwards.
   Yay for personal continuity!
3. I completely forgot about the artist, they've released new stuff I enjoy,
  and I'm about to talk about some of them now!

It is nice to see I've kept a few of my old bands,
from my old life as a musician who listened to a lot of music.

a large number of videos or channels didn't release much after I subscribed around 2011,
but there is a small gleaming kernel of stuff I can get back into now.

chief of which is:

Toyface
------

Beige Walls - feels a little dated now,
with its affected Kate Nash-esque estuary glo''al stops and boho fashion.

But the performance still holds up.
None of that detracts from strong and pure performance in the
version from BD's channel.

And today, there are 3 releases from 2011 to 2015 on [her bandcamp](toyface.bandcamp.com).

Maybe I should see if she still performs live? She's listed as then being based in Bristol,
but that could be out of date.

I've stuck a load of the orther old subscriptions in the 2009-2011 section,
because that *is* when I listened to them.

John Cale & Brian Eno - Spinning Away
--------

Not directly related to rediscovering my old subscriptions,
but it turns out Sugar Ray's song "spinning away" from The Beach soundtrack
is a cover of this song.

I love both versions.

Hildegaard Von Bingen
------

A German medieval polymath nun (what a set of adjectives), I originally knew of Hildegaard
through her constructed language, possibly the first in human history.

The album (or rather modern compilation of compositions) I've listened to -- Hortus Deliciarum --
is claimed by a commenter to be the work of another Herrad of Landsberg, a French nun.

True or not, if this claim is plausible then it at least offers a similar artist recommendation!

Discovered through the recommended videos after a cold watch of Miserere Mei, Deus 

### Middle

First AId Kit
------------

Swedish sister duo performing rural chamber folk. Same genre as Fleet Foxes.
Sound like they're from Antebellum Southern United States when they sing, almost.


July 2019
========

### Late

Julia Jacklin
------------

Her words are too powerful. Perhaps I will describe her another time. Later.

Don't Know How to Keep Loving You is too much for me.  
And so is Don't Let the Kids Win.


Brilliant Italian composers, who did a lot of soundtrack work
-----

* Angelo Badalamenti
* Ennio Morricone

I'm starting to notice just how good at music Italiy is!

Not necessarily mass-produced, poppy shite,
but hidden gems and Art with Passion behind them.

### Early

Black Monument Orchestra

Afro-futurist music-dance ensemble. Entrancing, amazing and deep.

Sounds a bit like what trip-hop could have been, 
if it lasted and involved more 'real' instruments and fewer samples.

June 2019
========

Unloved
-----

Their songs are all over the series 'Killing Eve', 
which is also where I first heard them.

Kind of Angelo Badalamenti, neo-60s noir atmospheric indie.

Mitchell Doxon - Woman Fireworks
----

Actually 'stock' music or whatever, but really catchy all the same.

Meiko Kaji
-----

Singer of that Kill Bill japanese song, incuding words sounding like
'domo Rhino' and 'shin day teh'


May 2019
========

### Late weeks

Miserere mei, Deus by Gregorio Allegri
-----

Presumably the origin of the term 'Gregorian Chant'. Stark, cold, beautiful plainchant. Pure and unforgiving. Yet tinged with a deep sadness. Like the winter frost on a lake, after a year of terrible plague. Death comes for you, it is known. But you are too enraptured by its beauty to take action.

Romeo & Juliet - Fantasy Overture by Tschaikovsky
-------

That overused, cheesy 'falling in love at first sight' music that is mostly relegated to lazy adverts trying to be funny these days. Said famous bit is about 14 minutes into the piece.


### Middle Weeks

Album "Slow Air" by Still Corners
-------------

A really chill, sensual relaxing album that still has some musical movement.

Sounds like exploration of natural wonders, beautiful waterfall scenes,
and good for sexy times.
Sort of like The XX, but with more guitars and only a female singer.
Second half of the album is developing some serious M83 overtones.

### First Week

YouTube channel "Elif'in Hecesi"
------

Spiritual-sounding acoustic world music, esp. Turkish and Islamic temperament sounding. 
Very atmospheric tracks by various artists.
Brotherhood of peace among all peoples, Gaia the World Spirit, etc.


April 2019
=======

### First week

After clicking around after Daft Punk's Robot Rock (also a super song!),

Discovered a friggin' amazin' new electronic artist:

French 79
-----

I presume they actually are (maybe just he is?) French, though maybe Belgian.
I saw that they're playing in Liège, so.

Mostly instrumental. Would fit well with the V A P O R W A V E crowd,
though I personally feel his sound has a bit more substance to it than the average compilation I've heard.

March 2019
=====

### Week 4

Hitting Marina And The Diamonds hard, in anticipation of her new album coming out next month.
Listened to her last album (2015's FROOT) for the FIRST TIME!

It _is_ a different experience than the previous two, but that's called artistic growth!

I like it now, and I what I've heard so far from the new album
(although I think Orange Tree is trying a little too hard to be radio friendly,
with its autotune chorus)

### Week 3

Bought the albums of Young Scum & Hot Freaks that I love so much, Through Bandcamp.

Rediscovered Geographer, who has a load of new material (also on Bandcamp), 
since it's been a few years.

February 2019
======

### last week

Discovered that the helmsman from The Orville, Scott Grimes, is a talented soft-rock singer!
So been listening to his stuff out of surprise, interest and because he's genuinely good.

### Middle Weeks

Listening to a lot of classical music, particularly Opera; particularly Verdi and Rossini.
But also:-

* Habanera from Carmen
* Smetana - Moldau . A song I had in my head for several years as a child.
* Funiculi Funicular - that pizza song from Spider-man 2. Almost offensive in its cartoonishly Italian-ness.
* O mio babbino caro - typically beautiful Italian aria.
* Barcarolle "Belle nuit, o nuit d'amour" by Jacques Offenbach from The Tales of Hoffmann
    - the song from the Synchronised Swimming scene in "Hail, Caesar"!
* J.S. Bach - Prelude in C Major

January 2019
===========

A lot of Japanese City-pop, particularly Tatsuro Yamashita (and his more famous wife, 
Mariya Takeuchi)

Also some more 70s Turkish pop, such as 
* Barış Manço
* Erkin Koray

Some weird shit, like microtonal music from `sevishmusic`, and King Gizzard et al.

December 2018
=============

Young Scum
----------

Delicious indie pop with that Decemberists New England Aesthete autotune voice.
So good!

Jazz, and maybe some Funk
----

* John Coltrane
* Herbie Hancock

Yeah jazz!

November 2018
=============

Realising some of my Joy Division tastes actually encroach into full Goth territory,
I decided to jump down the rabbit hole with both legs (?) and try the really 'gothy' stuff.

This appears to be called 'Darkwave'.

Bands include:-

* Molly Nilssen
* The Frozen Autumn
* Linea Aspera
* Pleasure Symbols

I also have been listening to Psychedelic Rock, including:

* King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard
    - (and their million or so recorded albums)
* The Re-Stoned
* My Sleeping Karma


October 2018
===========

Radio 1 Ibiza Prom
-------

a brilliantly-performed collection of 'safe' BBC-friendly dance classics - fat boy slim etc

YouTube User Vincent MT - Composition No 3
-----

Molly Nilsgren - new wave super retro 80s, but in that obviously very current way.
Most active in 2015, so maybe a bit of a trendsetter? (or maybe I just missed the start)

half.alive
---------

super-polished, super-slick, super-commercialised electronic pop-funk.

You can practically feel the california ideology and apple products sublimating off them.

haha "looks like an urban outfitters commercial"

Grauzone
-------

Short-lived 80s German New Wave band. Sound (to me) very similar to Joy Division.

Anne Clark
---------

80s spoken-word British techno artist popular in Germany,
who sounds about 10 years ahead of her time.

Peter Schilling
-------------

The commercialised side of the 80s German New Wave. Good Song: Major Tom ist Vollig Losgelöst
(Also the theme song to Deutschland '83)

The Soft Moon
-----------

Another continuation of that Joy Division sound. First album really good,
second experiments with noise a bit too much for me

Tei Shi
------

Similar-ish, sound to Grimes, but tamer. Consciously uses sex as a self-promotion tool.
Resultingly, I'm not sure about her yet.

Scratch that, she's a bit like HAIM.Or maybe that's just her KEXP performance.

Plus, she's no more sexed-up than the lead singer of CHVRCHES. She can't help being attractive.

Gülden Karaböcek
---------------

Who had that one 70s Turkish disco hit 'Nem Kaldi'
Turns out the rest of her career is similar to that!

Chromatics
---------

More hyper-80s New Wave (Old Wave?)

Tennis
------

Really sweet dreampop


September 2018
============

Mariya Takeuchi
--------------

Song: Plastic Love

Drinks
-----

Experimental (from the standpoint of music theory) duo.
Best song - real outside

Cate le Bon
----------

Brilliantly Welsh singing voice. British solo artist,
who's been floating around for about 10 years now.

artist with a unique feel.
Best song: Are you with me now

Courtney Barnett
--------------

Deadpan lyricist who is musically doing the typical 2010s thing of grunge/late 60s early 70s rock.
Best song: Pedestrian at Best, whose video is also brilliant

Chillwave, Synthwave, Serious Vaporwave, Whatever
--------------------------------------------

You can tell its popularity vogueness because of the million names it has.

That purple-pink=blue neon hyper-synth-80s stuff, with computer grids and Lamborghinis. But music.

Turkish 70s disco mixes
---------------------

Especially one song, Nem Kaldı by Gülden Karaböcek 

Mansun
------

Classic 90s rock band from Chester. Sound a bit like Manic Street Preachers, but rockier.

Jake Chudnow
-----------

Mind Expanding synthy electronic scores to Vsauce videos. Really frigging good!


August 2018
===========

Chance the Rapper
---------------

Good rap that is not about being a gangster.

Alfa Mist
--------

Album 'Antiphon' - cool UK jazz hip-hop fusion

----

Aesthetic synthwave

The Super-Funky Stylings of Mr Isamu Ohira
-------------------------------------

From the Gran Turismo games. That classic lift-music jazzy super-bass-player fusion shit.

Kelela
-----

Modern R&B, which means all those synthy vibes


July 2018
=======

Schlägernächte
-------------

German Summer festivals for cheesy oom-pah modern folk music. Hours of guilty pleasures.
Music to drink beer and bop to!

Ancient Tribal Nordic
------------------

Discovered that there is a genre forming around the sound that Wardruna pioneered.

Here are some of the other bands in what is now another genre I don't knwo the proper name of:

* Heilung
* Forndom
* Danheim
* leidungr 
    - (these might be neo nazis, judging from their imagery.
      There's always one that ruins it for everyone else)


Altın Gün
---------

70s Turkish disco rock revival. As awesome as it sounds.

Khruangbin
---------

Apparently Thai-inspired (I don't think so, having listened to their cited influence)
very 3-piece 60s surf rock. Super chill, understatedly sexy

Childish Gambino
----------------

It's the good Donald!

Mr. Glover's thought-provoking and often neurotic rap. Watch him grow up through his career!
Political, but only because it's political to be young, gifted and Black in Amerikkka

* Early Destiny's Child - Bills, Bills, Bills
* Kelly Rowland - Stole

Lauryn Hill
---------

Album - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill

Beldina
-------

Swedish R&B with that classic "Angels With Dirty Faces"-era Sugababes sound.

-----------

* Jessica Garlick
* Loreen - Euphoria (won 2012 for Sweden)
* Salvador Sobral - Amar Pelos Dois (won 2017 for Portugal)
* Polina Gagarina - A Million Voices (regrettably catchy, gushy Russian 2015 entry,
  with overtones of Frozen)
* Emmelie De Forest - Only Teardrops (2013 Entry for Denmark)

Luísa Sobral
------------

Sophisticated jazz, mostly in Portuguese. She wrote the 2017 winning Eurovision song with her brother,
who had less of an existing career to risk on performing there ;)


April 2018
=========

Jonathan Coulton
--------------

New album drop 'Solid State'

The Gasolina Song
---------------

Spanish chavvy song with a great beat


March 2018
=========

Jessica Lea Mayfield
------------------

She had new shit out. Not sure I liked it as much as the older stuff,
but I'm glad she's happier. Also some KEXP live concerts.


February 2018
===========

The OneUps - Koopa Beach

A fantastic jazz cover.

Atoms For Peace
-----

Thom Yorke, Nigel Godrich, Flea.


January 2018
===========

Tomcraft - Loneliness
-------------------

Classic trance pop song from the mid noughties. Very playable on a bass guitar!


November 2017
============

PPF
---

AKA Poop Poop Fart. Mostly Video game YouTube covers, on interesting arrangements of instruments.
Got me into the Cahon.

Yasunori Mitsuda
--------------

Scored the Chrono games. Really musically interesting style, very serene but mystic.


October 2017
===========

(more Smooth McGroove, esp. his many Undertale covers)

Songs from Community
--------

* Michael Haggins - Daybreak
    - That 'hold music' song from Community, when they ran out of music budget after licensing ABBA.
    - It's so good though! who cares if it's stock!?
* Ben Folds - The Ass-Crack Bandit
* The 88 - At Least It Was Here
* Ludwig Göransson - Greendale Is Where I Belong (he's also Childish Gambino's producer!)

Joe Hisaishi - Music of the Celestial Beings
----------

The end song from the film, "The Tale of Princess Kaguya". The saddest happy song.


August 2017
=======

Spencer Davis Group - Gimme Some Lovin'
-----------

That awesome driving grooving song from the Blues Brothers.

The band (Spencer Davis Group) is actually a bit of a forgotten pride of Britain. More awesome music!

Another song: Keep on Running (you'll recognise it!)


July 2017
=========

Investigating the Careers of the Members of Hot Freaks, before and after it
--------

* Vicious vicious - ho baby
* SPEARZ - joke britney cover band by (i think) 2 of the members
* Night Moves - 60s/70s rock/soul. May contain Hot Freaks' guitarist.
    - similar to Tame Impala imho
    - Their song 'Colored Emotions' is a smasher.


Ryuichi Sakamoto (Trio?)
--------

He also wrote 'Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence'

### Song: Rain

Oh my god, when I relistened to this just now (30 October 2018) and it went straight to my soul.

Contemporary japanese, mostly classical instruments. May be from a JRPG.

Full of feeling.

June 2017
========

listened to  old favourites:
* Hello Seahorse!
* Smooth McGroove
* Hot Freaks

Checked out Brand New. I can't remember their sound now (30 October 2018),
so they can't have made that much of an impression.

Giles Corey
--------

Depressing postrock about suicide, as far as I can tell.

May 2017
======

(What little time I wasn't still listening to and investigating RHCP's hidden gems):

Investigated 19th century propaganda music & national anthems:

* Land of Hope and Glory
* God Save The Tsar!
* Coronation Anthem - Zadok The Priest

April 2017
=========

Discovered an entire album's worth of songs from RHCP's BTW recording sessions.
Such a gift. Truly made my month. No, 3 months.

After discovering this, also found that there is a fan remaster of californication,
which sounds a lot better than the clipped shit on the CD.

Couple that with a tracklist amendment by me, and I've basically
had a 2-album drop of new Red Hot Chili Peppers songs from (what is for me) their golden age.

YUSSSSSSS

Musically, this (nearly) occupied the rest of the month, along with searching for good songs
from other recording sessions, and checking an obscure wiki for lists of unpublished songs.

Radiohead
---------

### Album: Moon Shaped Pool

Discovering new shit from **my** version of the RHCP, I decided to go looking for other unheard stuff
from my favourite bands. Discovered this album from Radiohead.


The end song from the film, "The Tale of Princess Kaguya"

March 2017
=========

(Still listening to Wardruna, Porter Robinson)

silly shit
--------

* Tongo - Chop Suey
* CEREAL FOR HUMAN
* Don't stomp by youtube user PilotRedSun


Classical Stuff
--------------

* Profokiev - dance of the Knights
* Bizet - Carmen
* Offenbach  - Can Can



February 2017
============

Porter Robinson
---------

Synth electronic artist with that chill GTA5 sound.
Rather chiptuney too. So very good.

Just noticed one song has an Anamanaguchi remix, so definitely chiptune-related.

Later turned out a LOT of his sound might have come from the songs (and more generally the genre) he 'sampled'
(namely, 80s japanese pop).

Best song: Goodbye to a World (which is one of those songs chiefly derived from an existing one)

Madeon
------

The suggestions include M83, which I think is appropriate for both this and Porter Robinson.

Seem to be part of the crest of a wave of great synth which earlier included M83.

Vanilla
------

Esp. album 'Origin'.

More of that chill synth stuff.

It's got those panpipes in it that make it sound like an actual one of those hippie chillout tapes
(that your mum and dad played on long holiday drives & days out in the Sierra)

Deru
----

Sad slow synth songs. Reminds me of Lavender Town and UNKLE. But more ambient. Desolate.

--------

Songs from the Les Misérables Musical
-----------------------------

* Do you hear the people sing
* Red & Black

Songs from Steven Universe
-------------------------

* It's over (isn't it)
* love me like you

------

Third Eye Blind - Can I Graduate
----------

Exposed to by the Guitar Hero games, but this one song of theirs paints this
story of a vulnerable young man trying to get his life back together.

Buttering Trio
------------

Smooth Israeli funk/jazz/new wave/trip-ho

KerenDun
-------

More trip hoppy stuff. Probably from related videos to Buttering Trio.

Loses points for teasing nudity as virality booster in video.

Play Dead
---------

80s subculture rock band: "played alongside contemporaries such as Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,
Killing Joke and the Chameleons,
but sadly never quite managed the same levels of success as them".

also PlayDead
-----------

on bandcamp! https://playdead.bandcamp.com/ - synths n shit

Sounds a bit like a clever fuckboy imitating radiohead's experimental electronic side.


January 2017
============

Coccolino Deep
-------------

Chillwave (I think?) DJ mixing some seriously trance-inducing, relaxingly rhythmically music into
into hour-long YouTube videos themed to a film.


December 2016
===========

Wardruna
-------

Tribal Nordic (apparently metal?) wardrum-heavy ancient vibes

Exist Strategy
----------

Post-Rock, I think. Found it in the archives. 
Originally a recommendation from a BBC Radio Cymru music show I listened to.

Chicago - 25 or 6 to 4
----------------------

An old favourite song of mine.


November 2016
============

Bill Wurtz
---------

Super-weird Youtuber who also makes super-technical jazz-funk-fusion (in the japanese style)
with nonsense lyrics

The Police
----------

Comparing their live performances in 1983 and a reunion tour in 2008

Faun
-----

German metal-looking celtic-folk.

Maybe a bit socially conservative,
but I can't understand the german well enough to tell just how much they want women back in the kitchen. 

So it's fine??


October 2016
===========

Rolemusic
--------

8 bit and chiptune. Good song: 'Enthalpy'

Godspeed You! Black Emperor
-----------------------

Classic Post-Rock


Procol Harum - A Whiter Shade of Pale
---------

Absolute. Classic.


Schlager
-------


A german genre, basically the unbroken continuation of true folk music,
which has become something between eurodance, oompa-music,
and seemingly football chants.

German 'folk' music; sort of a cross between knees-up folk songs and whatever genre Steps is. Eurodance?

Music to spill beer to.

totally against my usual tastes, but I suppose the German-ness makes it ok!

Artists include:

* Beatrice Egli (Mein Herz es brennt)
* Gina - (Zwillingstern)
* Vanessa Mai (Ich sterb für dich)
* Andreas Gabalier (I sing a Liad für Di) (swiss german or something)


September 2016
==============

Oh Wonder
---------

Jose Vanders finally got famous.


Rest of 2016
==========

Smooth McGroove
-------------

Video game acapella covers, from youtube. Sometimes not video game covers.
An awesome dude.


HAIM
----

Indie girl-band, reminiscent of Fleetwood-Mac

Hot Freaks
---------

Super catchy twee indie pop. Weeee! Sadly short-lived

Joey Joey Michaels
----------------

Hot Freaks' lead singer's solo work after their breakup.


2015
====

Mountain Goats
------------

Really lyrically poignant songs in a kind of folky indie style.

The song "No Kids" feels like a divorce. 
The soundtrack to the dissatisfaction in my marriage.

Lindscaldwell
-----------

YouTuber.

That perfect vocal style for traditional Irish folk.
Not great at guitar or audio quality, but good anyway.

AKA Lindsey Taylor, née Caldwell

Thee Oh Sees 
-----------

Twitchy, awkward, Punky fast rock with that 2010s late 60s early 70s flavour. Energetic.
Going for a surprisingly long time!

Tolkien Ensemble
---------------

Danish group (sort of a cross between a small orchestra and a folk band), writing and performing music to accompany the lyrics of songs from the Lord of The Rings books.

Best Song: The Old Walking Song


2014
====

Melody's Echo Chamber
-------------------

swirly, late 60s-feel Dreampop. First album.

GTA 5 Pause Music
---------------

Whatever that is. So into it that I made a (bad) cover


2013
====

Moon Hooch
---------

2 Saxophones, 1 drummer, all dance.

Black Keys
---------

Seriously cool Blues Rock revival 2 or 3 piece.
Got super-popular, and inspired Arctic Monkey's awesome AM album

Hello Seahorse!
-------------

Spanish-language indie band from Mexico; started off doing toy-folk twee-indie in English,
found its sound (which includes synthesizers), then gets gradually more orchestral throughout their career


2012
====

Active Child
------------

Expansive Electronic Soul Dream

Animal Collective
----------------

Esp. the album Merriweather Post Pavilion

Grimes
------

Techno-witch music with a Kawaii sort of influence

Listener
-------

Sounds like a small-town american alcoholic in his thirties 
(who could've been so much more if only he hadn't made bad choices),
coming to terms with his own mortality. 

Very bleak spoken-word poems over mournful post-rock.

Dead Can Dance
--------------

Album - Anastasis

Sweepingly orchestral new-age visceral experience

Justice
------

2011?
=====

Songs To Wear Pants To
--------------------

AKA Andrew Huang. An early internet musician, who was (for the time) unusually talented.

Adrian Holovaty
------

Gypsy-jazz guitarist from chicago
(which somehow makes it feels all the more real)

Along with covers of the old standards, he also does some more contemporary songs
in the gypsy hazz style.

Andy Rehfeldt
----------

Metallised and de-metallised covers of pop songs.

He may have started this as a joke, but the high production-value,
and the accompanying synced video make it truly brilliant.

Best song: Motown cover of Beyoncé's Single Ladies,
with a music video referencing the proud tradition of girl groups.

Julia Nunes
-------

Julia Nunes Julia Nunes!

The queen of nerdy ukulele music. Also did live shows with Ben Folds,
and I'm sure Jonathan Coulton at some point.

Molly Lewis / SweetAfton23
--------

Similar to Julia Nunes, but at the time of discovery, 
much younger and therefore less polished.

Really good though!

Anchor & Braille - Blur
-------

Really fucking good song. Resignedly sad, but I just love it.

2010...
======

Cyriak
-----

weird-video artist & musician who predates YouTube, 
but like Weebl (and probably many others) has re-uploaded it all there.

Turns out (as of writing this in August 2019 ) 
that his music is often in micro-tonal scales -- possible 11 tone --
which of course adds to the weirdness.

Fever Ray
-----

2009?
=====

Deetak
-----

Songfighter whose tender vocal delivery and simplistic piano arrangements
really captivated me at the time.

Seems to have trailed off.


H.J. Freaks
----------

Come for the perfect storm of Japanese weirdness,
stay for the unrivalled technical skill on the bass guitar.

Has kept making videos to the present day (Augut 2019),
so there's lots to catch up on.

Might actually be trans, because I haven't seen a recent video of this bassist
not in a dress...



MysteryGuitarMan /Joe Penna
-----

Skilled guitarist who uses the magic of video editing to make very entertaining videos


Rob Scallon
-----

Started out as your garden-variety Metal Guitarist Dude, but over the years on YouTube
has honed his video-craft, and makes insightful videos about music.

Along with the occasional actual song.
