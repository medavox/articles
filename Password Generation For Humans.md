Secure, Human-Compatible Password Generation
=============================================


You will need:

one or more 6-sided dice
One or more big, obscure dictionary


* **Take the largest dictionary for the most obscure topic you can find.**

Uncommon languages are a good source, as are domain-specific technical dictionaries, eg a medical or science dictionary.

    in this example I'll be using Y Geiriadur Mawr ( The Big Welsh Dictionary), Ninth Edition



* **Roll one more dice than the number of digits in your dictionary's page count.**

    my dictionary has 367 pages (3 digits), so I will roll 4 dice.
    

* **Roll the dice (or the same die multiple times) and subtract 1 one from each result.**

These make up a number in base-6.
    
    My dice show 6655, so my random number is 5544


* **Convert this sesimal number to decimal.**

(use an online converter; search for "base 6 to decimal converter")

    using https://www.unitconverters.net/numbers/base-6-to-decimal.htm ,
    5544 (base-6) = 1288 (base-10)

* **Modulo this number with the number of pages in the dictionary, and add one.**
    
    (1288 % 367) + 1 = 188


* **Open your dictionary to this page.**


* **Use a technique to choose a random word from the two pages open in front of you.**

I like to close my eyes and drop my finger somewhere, but this may not be random enough.

    My finger landed on the word 'dirym', which is a Welsh adjective meaning 'weak'.
    Bear in mind that for my dictionary, I could have randomly ended up in the English-to-Welsh half,
    and therefore blind-picked an English word. This is fine.

* **To generate a long, strong password, do this process at least 3 times,**
with a different dictionary each time. 

The goal is to make up a phrase that is *at least* 10 characters long.

Whether to put spaces between the words, or even capitalisation is up to you (and the password policy!).

Make up a story in your head about the words if you can, to help you remember.

Password Policies That Require Numerals
---------------------------------------

* Roll some dice and convert the number to decimal, as described above.

The length of the number (the number of dice to roll) is your choice.

* Place this random number somewhere (preferably randomly) between (or within!) the words you've randomly picked.

Password Policies That Require Punctuation Or Other Symbols
-----------------------------------------------------------

Possible Technique For Selecting A Word From The Open Page
---------------

Roll a 6-sided die.

* On an even result, 
    - use the left page.
* On an odd result, 
    - use the right page.

Roll the die again.

* If the page is divided into 2 columns (such as a dictionary),
    - repeat the above procedure to choose the left or the right column.
* If it's divided in to 3 columns, 
    * 1-2 = left column
    * 3-4 = middle column
    * 5-6 = right column
* If the book is a normal form of test (divided into paragraphs),
    - choose a paragraph by rolling dice.
        * if the page has 6 or fewer paragraphs on this page, 
            - use the just-rolled result.
        * if there are more than 12 paragraphs on this page,
            - use a technique of choosing to pick a random number big enough.



Changing your password
=====================

When the time comes to change your password:


* **Drop a word from the existing phrase.**

I recommend you choose which one randomly.

* **Perform the word-choosing procedure above to add a new word to the existing phrase,
at a random position within it.**



Tips
====

if you find uncommon or foreign words hard to remember, limit yourself to just English words.

Just be aware that if you reveal you do this to anyone,
it will reduce the randomness (and therefore the strength) of the password.

If this is still difficult to remember, try limiting the word to particular types.
eg 4 nouns, or 2 nouns, an adjective and a verb. Make it a sentence, and feel free to add connecting words between them!

------

Avoid common English words, as these are often in word-lists that password crackers try.

-------

Write each randomly-chosen word on the back of your hand as you go,
then wash them all off later.

Obviously, only do this if you're performing this procedure when not being opverlooked.
