Cm
[Murphy it's you]
Etched in my head all the looks on their faces

Gm
[Murphy it's you]
the pleasure they took from my pain


[before they can't accept devices on the chrome/crime]
taunting and teasing and making bad jokes 

[you had a son you had wife you had a home]
just as if they were playing a game

[Murphy it's you]
how many corpses are given the chance to 

[What did they do?]
avenge themselves after they're lost

[Are you zombie or a robot or a man?]
Wait till I finally find them and force them to pay for the life that they cost
[Can you inmorpht or is your head an empty can?]/
[Can you remorter is your head in a tin can?]

[Murphy it's you]
I have to go now

[Murphy it's you]
I must not linger

[no one told me but I know it when I saw]
I will find these killers
[It's in your step it's in your voice it's in your jaw]
I'll use my finger

[So you better believe what I said]
So I better believe what she said
BOTH: all of it's true

BOTH: OCP brought me [you] back from the dead

MURPHY IT'S YOU
MURPHY IT'S YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
