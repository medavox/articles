(some) art has lost the ability to tell a story
to convey feeling effectively to all people
it needs to introduce the idea of testing to the work
actually getting the artist to ask someone who's completely unlike them to say what they think it means
I understand that some art is exploring the subtle and profound
the numinous
but some art tries to make us feel something
or express some concept
I often feel that the message has been lost on the audience
because the audience does not have an identical perspective to the author

art needs iterative development and testing
