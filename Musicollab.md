# Musical Collaboration Game

In order to play, you have to leave your ego at the door.
This means you agree not to take criticism personally, and be open to others' ideas and modifications to your work.

The game starts when someone records themselves (or others!) playing a piece of music, then nominates someone to add to the song.

The starting player should share any musical info they know about the piece they recorded (chords, key, tempo in bpm). If they don't know, that's fine.


Each person: 
* can only add one track/video per turn
* can't take anything away
 (They can sample previous tracks to make new ones, but not remove the old ones)
* has to make the song better (in their opinion). 

Try to keep editing to a minimum - this is meant to be quick and fun, not perfect and stressful.


## Your Turn

You have 7 days from being nominated to take an action and then nominate the next player, or you miss your turn and the previous player gets to nominate someone else (you can still be nominated again later).

You can ask to be nominated, but it *is* the current player's choice.

### Action

Your action can be any of the following (or something else musical I hadn't thought of):

* Write lyrics (you don't have to sing them!)
* Add chords (write them down and share them)
* Record something vaguely musical (it can be anything: guitar, piano, singing, spoons, pot-and-pans)
    - On top of existing parts - like adding a bassline over a guitar part
    - Add to the song structure by recording new parts - after, before or in between existing sections! Like a bridge, or a second verse. Note that you might have to get a little fancy with editing to do this.
* Add notes for an existing track - write out chords, transcribe melody or lyrics, specify the key, 
* Skip a turn - this is fine! Maybe you got nominated by surprise and don't want to play; maybe you're too busy this week. Maybe you think the song is already perfect! ;)
* Move existing parts around - A little editing is ok, but too much and it can get stressful.

You can try as many takes as you like, but in the end your turn can only only consist of one new track - one can be playing at any one time (feel free to splice your one track together from your million takes, if you can be bothered :P)

Try to add useful notes for pieces you play - chords, lyrics etc. 

If you don't know (can't work out the chords etc), that's ok! Someone else might do it later.


Remember, you CAN'T remove your work from previous turns, and you DOUBLE CAN'T remove other people's parts.

Once you have completed your action, nominate the next player.


### Nominate

You can skip your action if you don't want to take it; you can still nominate the next player.

If you don't nominate someone, the previous player gets to choose again.

If you've taken a turn before, **there is no expectation for you to keep taking turns**. You can peace out and leave (or rejoin!) the game at any time.
You can ask to not be nominated again. 

When all active players skip their turn, the song is finished, and you have to post it somewhere for everyone to enjoy :)

Or it's just over when it's over. Just remember to share it! If you want. Whatever man.


You can work on what you want to add next even when it's not your turn. Just be aware that someone else might alter the song structure along the way!

## How to Add A Track

Play the working track through some ear- or headphones, then record yourself playing along to it.
Load it all up in audacity (other audio editors are available: wavepad is good too), and sync up your new track to the others.
If you can't sync up your new track, just nominate someone who can! ;) They still get to do something of their own if they want on their turn, though.

Remember - it doesn't have to be perfect. Plenty of famous songs have mistakes hidden in them.
