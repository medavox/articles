  I stayed up too late again

I told myself this was the end

Verse 2
======

was I naive to think
at 25 I'd have at least
 one thing figured out
without a doubt

Chorus

A       F#m        E
    I'm wasting my time

   Bm                     A
I don't know I don't know why

    F#m        E
I'm wasting my time
  Bm            A
I do it all the time

    F#m        E
I'm wasting my time

  Bm                      A
I don't know I don't know why

Verse 3
=======

Sad for no real reason
I'm really hating the season
waiting for a change
that'll never come

Verse 4
=======

Can I ever be content
knowing that each day I 
spend is another missed chance
no one cares
