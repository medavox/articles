the more actions per minute you take, the more time slows down for your faction
not doing anything can be an advantage if you just need to accrue resources


democratic gamespeed voting amongst players

simultaneous turn-based
have the player order vary according to an in-game mechanic, eg pokemon's SPEED
    could be per-unit or per-faction

allow multiple players to play as the same faction together, and divide responsibilities
may need a balancing mechanic to avoid this becoming OP

maybe instead of the traditional top-down 2D viewpoint, use the worms-style side-on artillery physics idea? (blastwurst)

Hurry-up Slowpokes:
simultaneous turn-based, where the amount of time left to complete your move is:
time passing per second =    1 - (number of players who haven't finished their turn) / (total number of players)
So there is no time limit when no one has finished yet,
but as more people are waiting, the remaining unfinished players have less and less time
(or the 60 "seconds" pass quicker and quicker, the end result is the same)
