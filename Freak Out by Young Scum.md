Saturday freak out again
I know it’s hard on you, it’s hard on me too

Promise it won’t happen again
Until it does. Just because


I watch summer die. 
With a long sigh
I watch it go by

But there you are your hand in my hair. 
Saying, “I don’t care about that.” 
Cause it’s only me and you
It’s only me and you


Ask myself, “what am i doing?” 
lost my old friends, i still see them.
Went home for a lost weekend,
something has changed. It’s not the same

I watch summer die
With a long sigh. I watch it go by

But there you are your hand in my hair.
Saying, “I don’t care about that.”
Cause it’s only me and you
It’s only me and you
