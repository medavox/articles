RTS game
===

a series of sub-games, played by a pool of 1 or more players
(who can elect themselves, say, Financial Minister, but can later switch or drop out):

internal economy & manufacturing, city building  
creating new cities/bases  
foreign/diplomacy/war minister - fighting battles using units, diplomacy during peacetime  
research & design (of units and defensive structures)  

roles (or jobs) could be optional (like religion), to give a group with a large number something for everyone to do  
or some jobs could be missed out, with negative consequences

Activities (to be shared between roles?)
------

do we actually need players to put on different hats, to manage different parts of the economy?

* building new cities
* exploring the map
* gathering resources
* setting up resource gathering
* agriculture
* trade with another civ
* manufacturing units
* building structures in cities - defensive and civic
* designing units
* designing defensive structurures
* turning resources into goods
* processing food
* researching & refining tech
	- miniaturisation
	- cheapening/speeding up manufacture
	- increasing power/effectiveness/efficiency/intensity

politics, militrary, science and economy

each minister would have control over their own area (eg finance would hand out the money), but if the 
Leader gets the support of a majority, they can overrule that minister on a decision

if people don't like the leader, an Election can be called for, in which the (AI controlled) population votes  
possibly also the other players vote

interactions between ministers (players) will be informed by a tension between helping each other, 
and guarding their own domain's interests. Eg finance minister giving the military minister lots of money
will make the military happy, but possibly inhibit national growth/productivity.
