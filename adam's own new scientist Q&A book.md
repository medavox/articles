and finally, this one wouldn't export properly, so here it is verbatim:

Q: What happens to your body if you die in space? Like what happens after you die? Do the bacteria inside your body decompose you or are they killed by something in space?

A: In space, the lack of oxygen means your body wouldn't decompose in the same way it does on Earth. Without the presence of bacteria and other decomposers, the body might mummify or freeze depending on the conditions. Essentially, it would remain quite preserved for a long time.

Q: Would it be preserved well enough to enable later resuscitation?

A: While a body in space might be well-preserved, it's unlikely to enable later resuscitation. The damage from vacuum exposure and freezing would be irreversible. Plus, current technology and medical knowledge don't support reviving someone from such a state.
