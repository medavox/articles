The age of the internet will be seen as another dark age to future historians and archaeologists
no one is writing anything down anymore, on a physical medium which will survive more than ~10 years

Websites only last as long as the company which runs them,
most of which are startups that fail in 5 years
technology is by definition constantly changing,
so not only do old resources require:
* constant energy input to keep the server running and
* constant financial inut to pay for the hosting,

but they also require constant technology development to
remain up-to-date enough to be read by modern-ish hardware.

Capitalism has perpetuated the churn of newer hardware replacing the old,
even though it's no longer necessary from a speed standpoint

In 50 years, nothing physical and readable will exist from our time,
if we don't do something to actively change this
