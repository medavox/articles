Creamy Hot Peanut Milk
=====================

Here's my recipe for a cheap, creamy vegan bedtime drink:

You will need:

* a hand blender, or jug blender that can withstand hot liquids
* smooth peanut butter (a big tablespoon scoop of it, so roughly 30g)
* a big measuring jug or tall-sided mixing bowl (mine is 2L but you could probably get away with a smaller one)
* a tablespoon (an 18ml spoon)
* a kettle, or another way of boiling water
* 600ml clean drinking water
* a teaspoon of sugar (optional!)
* a mug for drinking from :)

1. Using your tablespoon, scoop a big-ish dollop of peanut butter from the jar, 
and place it (and optionally the tablespoon, if the peanut butter is stuck to it) 
into the measuring jug.

2. (Optional) add the teaspoon of sugar over the peanut butter, 
if you are doing that.

3. pour the boiled water into the jug and over the peanut butter,
and stir until the dollop melts into the water.

4. Remove the spoon from the jug, then blend the mixture.

  Be careful not to melt the business end of your hand blender,
  if it's only barely happy with hot liquids like mine is.

5. Give it a little stir and serve immediately, with a teaspoon
(so you can stir it, to keep it from settling)

Be careful: the foamy top layer keeps the liquid underneath **very** hot for a long time!
