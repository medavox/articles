my problem with a lot of anime is actually a problem with the fact it's made for kids and  under-socialised teenagers
it telegraphs every emotion loudly, its characters explain every reaction very, very verbosely
so there's no chance of misunderstanding characters
it's so very easy to understand a character's motivations,
because each one spends like 10 IRL minutes laying them out comprehensively

I have to do no work when watching it
I don't have anything to think about

it's all just "oh, hmm. Ok, well if that's how you say it happened, then OK?"
there's nothing left for me to do with it other than sit back, switch off, 
and passively have everything explained to me in exhaustive (and exhausting!) detail for 30 minutes

it's patronising for me  now
