Star Trek Re-Do
=====

no transporters - they just make no sense, and ruin perfectly good stories, remove threat.  
site-to-site replication might exist, beaming the things energy and 'blueprint',  
but this could easily act as a weapon, given the energy content of matter  

gay and trans people exist!

no holodeck - however a matrix-like neural simulator exists, but is controversial  
tactile button-based controls for priority posts  
replicators exist, but require supplies of raw materials  
many people prefer to cook their own food, replicating the ingredients instead  
the UFP's success is due to fusing the pursuit of scientific knowledge with compassion for fellow people  
due to logistical constraints, starships are usually single-species environments, so that their atmospheres, temperatures, humidities, aromas etc can be tailored to the comfort of their crew  
forcefields are limited, and have not replaced airlocks  
orbital mechanics are respected, as are the newtonian laws of motion  
planetary exploration is carried out by specially-trained away-teams (rather than bridge crew),  
launched in drop-ships

warp drive exists because it has to, for the star trek universe to work at all  
it's a riff on the alcubierre drive theory  
the UFP operates as an 'Asynchronous Society': because of the time dilation effects of warp drive,  
solar systems are isolated pockets of local time.  
Going on a far intersolar mission means 50 or more years will have passed back home  
this is why starship crew bring their family along!

Artifical life has been banned, after a war for survival which nearly wiped out all biological life  
computers and large computing machines are allowed, but neural nets are forbidden,  
	and small electronics are allowed on a case-by-case basis  
along with this, electronic body modification is an extreme taboo(maybe?)  

articial gravity exists as a passive technology: that is, it works even when unpowered.

use fewer-to-no examples of an american metaphor -- no big, heavily-armed military organisation with thinly-veiled colonial tendencies
no "it's for your own good" and gunboat diplomacy
replicators can assemble relatively simple shapes from existing materials -- but they can't perform alchemy; they need the right raw materials

What if there were other multi-species civilisations, with high-minded goals not dissimelar to the Federation itself;
yet it and the Federation have tense relations (possibly due to a disagreement on some obscure political principles,
a la the tendency of the Left to schism)?

Realism of Details
-----
* Seatbelts.
* People have to finish announcing their intended recipient before a comm badge connects them
* Stop referring to Starfleet as "Humans", or acting like everyone in starfleet knows all about Earth history
* No more tokenboobs catsuit & pushup bra crewmembers; just put the same characters in a normal uniform!

Increased Scientific Accuracy
----

### General

* Use real units and materials where possible -- no gigaquads, instead gigabytes; no isorems but rather millisieverts.
* Equally, stop inventing a new form of radiation every week as a throwaway plot-point
* No wave or beam can penetrate a planet, without also destroying that planet
* Heat dissipation and deceleration are still challenges 
* R-squared law must still be respected -- for all things, like explosions, sounds, point-sources
    - parabolic dishes should also come into play at least as much as they already do -- ie the Deflector Dish

### Space Travel

* There are crazy, enterprise-like starship designs, and then there are those suitable for atmospheric travel.
* A ship with big sticky-out nacelles on thin pylons will always suffer unnecessary structural stresses when turning at speed;
    - structural forcefields would help, but only with enough power to run them.  
More sensible designs should always win out  

### Medicine

* Individuals are not suddenly and irrevocably dead when a machine makes a persistent whining noise
* Also stop using the 80s medical drama of defibrillator usage


Key technological advances:
----
manipulation of gravity  
highly efficient reaction drives (needing far less fuel than anything today)  
warp drive (an extension of the gravitational technology)
