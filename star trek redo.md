Star Trek Re-Do
=====
no transporters - they just make no sense.  
site-to-site replication might exist, beaming the things energy and 'blueprint',  
but this could easily act as a weapon, given the energy content of matter  

gay people exist


no holodeck - however a matrix-like neural simulator exists, but is controversial  
tactile button-based controls for priority posts  
replicators exist, but require suuplies raw materials  
many people prefer to cook their own food, replicating the ingredients instead  
the UFP's success is due to fusing the pursuit of scientific knowledge with compassion for fellow people  
due to logistical constraints, starships are usually single-species environments, so that their atmospheres, temperatures, humidities,  
aromas etc can be tailored to the comfort of their crew  
forcefields are limited, and have not replaced airlocks  
orbital mechanics are respected, as are the newtonian laws of motion  
planetary exploration is carried out by specially-trained away-teams (rather than bridge crew),  
launched in drop-ships

warp drive exists, because it has to, for the star trek universe to work at all  
it's a riff on the alcubierre drive theory  
the UFP operates as an 'Asynchronous Society': because of the time dilation effects of waro drive,  
solar systems are isolated pockets of local time.  
Going on a far intersolar mission means 50 or more years will have passed back home  
this is why starship crew bring their family along!

Artifical life has been banned, after a war for survival which nearly wiped out all biological life  
computers and large computing machines are allowed, but neural nets are forbidden,  
	and small electronics are allowed on a case-by-case basis  
along with this, electronic body modification is an extreme taboo(maybe?)  

articial gravity exists as a passive technology: that is, it works even when unpowered.

there are crazy, enterprise-like starship designs, and then there are those suitable for atmospheric travel.


Key technological advances:
----
manipulation of gravity  
highly efficient reaction drives (needing far less fuel than anything today)  
warp drive (an extension of the gravitational technology)
