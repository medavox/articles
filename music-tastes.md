-------------------------

In summary, I really like music that either:

* makes me want to get up and dance (or headbang),
* heavily repetitive music that sends me into a trance-like state,
* atmospheric, usually relaxing music that often feels mind-expanding

When making music myself,
========================

I'm a fan of:

* layered vocal harmonies when possible, 
* driving basslines (not necessarily complex but definitely gives the song a push,
* dancable drum rhythms (especially interesting, almost african or carribean style),
* and some 8 bit stuff maybe thrown in there.

I use rhythm guitar (electric or acoustic) to add meat to the sound, and build dynamic range in the choruses;
but I often try to use another instrument for rhythmically strummed chords if the song suits it - like a ukulele or mandolin.

I don't have access to a keyboard, organ or synth (and don't play them very well anyway), but am all for putting them in a song!

I often aim to use the most unusual instruments in a song that I can play reasonably well - makes the music sound more unique imho.
