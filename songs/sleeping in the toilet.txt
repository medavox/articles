[palm-muted, jazzy (maybe minor 7) chords]

sleeping in the toilet 
sleeping in the toilet at work

[Loud and obvious, power or major chords]

THIS IS RIDICULOUS
YOU'VE GOT TO GET UP AND DO SOMETHING
YOU DON'T WANT TO FIRED
YOU'VE GOT TO EARN YOUR WAGE
FOR GOD'S SAKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING

sleeping in the toilet
just sleeping in the toilet at work

didn't go to bed early enough
or at least, didn't go to sleep

kept 
doing that thing
watching that thing
playing that game
scrolling the feed
reading that site
wasting the night

wasting the night, oh
wasting the night
night is for sleeping
your mother always told you
night is for sleeping

she said a lot of things
that you can't remember now
because you're so tired

so you're

sleeping in the toilet
sleeping in the toilet at work
sleeping in the toilet
sleeping in the toilet at work yeah


should've 
gone to that thing
met up with friends
had a few drinks
called it a night

but no

remember that time
(when you were) aged seventeen
when you stayed up-all-night
and then you went to school
