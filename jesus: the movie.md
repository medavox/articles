if jesus was a comic book character, and a film adaptation was made of his story,

* the setting would be 'updated' to modern day
* all of the important female characters in his life would be rolled into one, to 'streamline' the story,
	- who would also be the love interest, having very little characterisation beyond "generic white female"
* some joke at the expense of his fans (implying they don't get out much or something) would be made at some point
* he would undoubtedly be played by some strapping white chap
* one (just one) character would be played by a black person
* there might also be a token british character
* if there is even a sniff of an historical theme, expect it to be riddled with unexplainable (mostly) fake british accents
