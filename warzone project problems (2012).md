Good Points
----------
+ play guides are well maintained, making the game feel like a game again instead of a charity case
+ map and mod pages exist
+ lobby exists, and update multiplayer technologies helps game stay compatible with modern gaming practices
+ map & mod files have been made more openly editable

Bad Points
---------
- existing map and mod files have been made completely incompatible wih current codebase, with no (afaik) easy way of updating them without insider knowledge of game engine
- no release date for latest version on mainpage
- widely available versions for linux & windows are not the same, and are incompatible for multiplayer
- no native (maintained) build instructions for Windows (!), poorly defined list of build requirements
- project development is focused on continued game redesign of a legacy product, alienating older players, instead of maintenance and bugfixes
