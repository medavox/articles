```
quivering/grunting with emotion
shouting when upset
speaking in unison
spangly backgrounds
dropping to one's knees from shock
verbose language/jarring word choice during normal speeches
smug chuckling to oneself as a sign of being evil/powerful
all <35yo women's knees being apparently glued together
hair moving with emotion
general shoutiness/verboseness
the same 5 voice actors in every dubbed series
standing around looking scared, making verbose speeches (or making a solemn vow) to no-one when the best option is to act
generally, making speeches about human nature when direct action is needed
anger/determination = power
girls' characters get even further emasculated (made into sighing, whimpering, baby-voiced giggling objects) when translated into american
weird turns of phrase and slight misuse of words
no old women voice actors, everyone is either a teenage boy, alex armstrong or the same girl voice
so much animation of blowing hair, so little else
over the top acting, bizarre emphasis on poorly-chosen words
