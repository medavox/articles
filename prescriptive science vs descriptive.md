teach more about the times it's appropriate to be prescriptive --
in maths and physics, there is often a correct answer or two --
and times when it's not, such as in language.

The difference is, in physics there are answers which are independently derivable;
that is, you can come to the same answer as someone else,
without 

in language, this idea of a single correct, or good, accent or language was for centuries mis-applied.
They wrongly drew a comparison between objective truth,
and the language or dialect of a prestige culture - a culture with political power.

These days, linguists realise that treating one dialector language as 'higher' or 'more correct'
than others merely throws away data; it wilfully ignores valuable insight ino the possible ways language can vary,
and therefore help us understand how language works.

All languages are equally valid expressions of a universal* human ability.
However, language is not a fundamental truth about the universe.
It's a fundamental truth about humans right now.
It may not survive our species, but physics will.

This doesn't imbue Physics with a greater worth than human sciences,
because we experience everything about the universe through the lens of being human.
Understanding ourselves is key to understanding the universe correctly,
and differentiating our biases from the objective.

\*Excepting rare special cases, 
such as those with learning disorders and feral children.
Even in those cases, they are capable of some degree of languages, 
or are biologically capable, but failed to receive sufficient linguistic stimulus at key developmental stages.


The political power of groups changes over time.
British English has become less fashionable, in favour of American English.

In Physics and other fields with a degree of objective truth to them, the facts don't change.
Once something has been proven to be correct, it will always remain so.
Even in cases (like with Newtonian laws) where something has later been shown not to hold for some edge cases,
it still retains value as a valid model, given the right context.

There can be subjective interpretations at the edges of what is known;
but this is more a symptom of our lack of understanding;
competing ideas trying to explain the same phenomena.

There are ultimately two forms of science: ob
