The 2020 Guide to Munhan
=======================

It's been a while since I wrote down a complete guide to Munhan,
and it's evolved somewhat since.

This guide was written in December 2019, so it's convenient to say
that this is a guide for Munhan, as used from 2020 onwards.

* Written in columns bottom-to-top, left to right
* Syllables form a block, connected by a stem[^1]
* The main grouping is by syllable, not by word. 
  But you can leave bigger gaps between words if you want.
* When handwritten on lined paper, hold the paper sideways and write
 vertically _on_ the lines, like this:

[example image: "example"]

[^1]: Unless the syllable's vowel is a schwa' see below.

Vowels
-----

Are written with strokes from a central vertical 'stem'.

[Example image: comprehensive list of every vowel, written out individually]

The more traditional representation:

[example image: beet bit boat traditional tree of vowels]

(This is with a non-rhotic accent of English btw. 
For American English speakers, these 3 vowels are often the same sound.)

Longer vowels are written by doubling them:

[example images:]

"lug" vs "learn"

"pen" vs "pair"

although this is relatively rare in English, and may not occur in your dialect.

Consonants
---------

Are written with horizontal 'branches', which lie across the stem. 
They're grouped by type, and voicing is indicated by a small diacritic.

### Stops

[lots of example images here]

p, t, k
b, d, g

### Nasals

m, n, ŋ 'ng'

### Liquids

l, r

### Fricatives

f, θ 'th', s, ʃ 'sh', h
v, ð 'dh', z, ʒ 'zh', /x/ 'ch/kh'

Which consonant you want is indicated from the branch is indicated with a little hook,
or a little fruit:

[example image: p t k]

A branch without a hook indicates the central consonant.
The hook usually curls back to touch the stem, forming a little fruit,
but this is only stylistic.

[example image: hook and fruit/bobble]

For fricatives, an extra branch must be drawn to indicate the left-middle
and right-middle consonants, and θ/ð ʃ/ʒ:

[example image: traditional 'extra branch' approach]

An newer way is to draw two fruit on the branch:

[example image: new 'two fruit' approach]

### Affricates

The English sounds 'ch' and 'j' are actually 2 sounds pronounced together /tʃ/ and /dʒ/,
so can be written with those consonants together:

[example image: traditional messy tʃ and dʒ]

However, this is a complicated shape to write for such common sounds,
so the following symbol can also be used:

[example image: the new affricate shape, which is basically the fricative branch with a + over it,
but the horizontal line touches each side of the branch]

### Voicing

Lots of pairs of consonant sounds differ from another one, 
only by whether your vocal chords vibrate when you pronounce it.
This is called voicing. We indicate it with a small diacritic bar:

[examples: every pair of voiced and unvoiced consonants, side-by-side]

For h, the voice-diacritic instead indicates the velar or uvular fricative /x/ or /χ/[^2],
uncommon in English, but found in 'loch'

[^2]: or in some cases in German, /ç/

Glides: W and Y
--------------

Are represented by the vowel shapes closest to them:

[examples: 'wet' and 'yet']

Because these sounds always occur before another vowel, there isn't too much ambiguity.

Punctuation
----------

Is pretty similar to English, but with a few adjustments for style and unambiguity.

[all of the following have example usages in a sentence]

O Full Stop 

9 Comma

Colon

Semi-Colon

Brackets []


Non-English Extensions
---------------------

The only one at the moment is for Welsh:

/ɬ/ 'll'

Future
------

## Features

* stress indications; maybe use a C-shape parallel to the block?
  - and a reverse-C for secondary stress, even??
* a numeral system that gels with the aesthetic
 still just place-based decimal though
* a way to indicate rounding on vowels
* ***PHONEMIC TONE??!***

### Other sounds

* glottal stop ʔ
* ɥ
* ɕ/ʑ
