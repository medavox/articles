# Totally Rad Time Tracker


A time-tracking program I wrote using AutoHotKey. Windows-only, sorry!

Contains a teensy bit of code from Serenity's [Shellhook Messages Tool](http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/32628-tool-shellhook-messages/).

```autohotkey
%include ../includes/TimeTracker-1.0.ahk
```
