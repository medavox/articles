time travel RTS
you don't control your empire in real time, but rather make precision strikes at points in the past,
in order to affect the future outcome.
the amount you can move through time is limited by a resource, 
which your empire needs to harvest for you

changes propagate through time, so the future will be instantly affected once you've changed the past.
The timeline in the game is 'actual time' in the game,
the timeline of the players playing the game is 'metatime'

story-wise, the players are Gods/time-travellers (depending on your perspective)
waging a war against each other, trying to recreate their home timeline.

maybe instead of an RTS, you actually play from a single person's perspective, 
and alter 'small' interactions: kill someone, break something...
