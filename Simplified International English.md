Simplified International English
===============================

simplified phonology paired with a spelling reform

Reduced Phonology
---------------

### Consonants

<y> = /ə, ʌ/

θ -> t, s or f, depending on the word
ð -> d, z or v, same


^ps -> s
/ʃ, ʒ/ -> x
ch /tʃ/ -> tx
ch /k/ -> k
H is deleted -- just don't pronounce it where it was before

Merge w and v
Merge s and sh, z and zh

### Vowels

Cot-caught merger
Bit-beet merger
Boat > boot1a

### Diphthongs

Monophthongisation

ai > a
ei > e


### Regular Simplification of Consonant Clusters

nt becomes n

Spelling Reform
--------------

ph -> f

short vowels signified by a single vowel letter, long vowels signified by two
Accent marker on vowel of stressed syllable
Unstressed schwa vowels can optionally be spelled with a y


Simplified Grammar
-----------------


No plural markings - all words act like the word 'sheep'
Regularised be, go, have - all verbs have no morphology


No I/me/my distinction - all me
Use of do-support replaces tense and other markers on verbs, eg "did fail" instead of "failed"
Question tag
