My Proposed Improvements to Toki Pona
=====================================

The goal of this offshoot is to make an improved version of Toki Pona that is more useful 
as an auxlang.

Although speakers can use phrases to describe things that other languages have a word for,
Toki Pona today lacks words for some basic building-block concepts.
This makes it extremely difficult to be understood clearly without using long,
roundabout, misinterpretable paragraphs for familiar things.

This is not a flaw of Toki Pona, but rather a result of its design.
You are not MEANT to be able express anything complex with it.
Its goal is to simplify speech, distilling the key meaning ; it is an artlang, a language of philosophy.

However, Toki Pona's simplicity has gained it a modest international following,
where it could potentially stumble into the role of an auxlang.
But its extreme simplicity also limits its potential to communicate.
In this role, it needs words for ideas that were previously left out or ignored.

I'm retooling Toki Pona for this new purpose, 
hopefully without compromising its central philosophy too much.

Its simplicity is its greatest strength; 
but I think that its inability to express fundamental parts of human existence should be fixed.

This document is a work-in-progress.

Word Definition Changes
-----------------------

No conflation between size/height/importance, simplicity/good;
    remove the common human fallacy of spatial-social equality double-meanings
* 'Suli':
    * remove 'important' meaning from 'suli'. 
        - Not all big things are important, not all small things aren't
    * remove 'heavy' meaning from 'suli'
        - rolling importance, size and weight into one word is a major source of confusion  
* remove 'simple' meaning from 'pona'
* remove 'divine' meaning from 'sewi'
* remove 'lower part' meaning from 'noka'. replace with 'noka pini' = leg ending
* add meanings 'barter/trade' to 'esun'(v)
* remove meaning 'money' from word 'mani'?
    - Money is neither simple, good nor necessary to lead a good life
    - In fact why do we even need a word for cattle?
        - why not 'sowelo moku suli' (hopefully meaning large food land-quadruped)?
* remove 'humble', 'lowly', 'bowing down' meanings from anpa

New Words
---------
* 'pusiki' important (from welsh bwysig)

* proper comparatives:

    more, ?molo
    less 
    (most? 
    least?)

* how about a word for amount/intensity?
* spatial words for left, right
words for frequency -- again, never, often, sometimes, rarely
    found: tenpo mute=many times, i.e. often
?passivity marker: a word which means the verb is being done TO the object (eg 'po')
    so 'pana' means give, 'po pana' means is given (receive)
    'utala' means attack, 'po utala' means is attacked
shape,
    maybe some shape descriptive terms like flat, straight, curvy, pointy, squat, longthin
    found:
* pain (n), hurt (v)
metal
hard/softness
    found: kiwen= hard object, metal, rock, stone
'opaka' heavy, difficult
help
work
co-operate/collaborate/work together (mitarbeiten)
keep, stop, again
stranger

sharp (as in knife)/spicy/sour/tangy

Reinstated Words
----------------

'kapesi' brown/grey; colour of slate, mud, metal
'leko' square, cube, block, square-shaped, cube-shaped
'majuna' old, age
'pasila' easy, simple, light (opposite of heavy)



New Grammar-Words
-------------

question marker word - turns a statement into a question of whether the statement is so
word meaning multiplier of next number word, so you can say 'four WORD twenty', 'five and twenty'

Word Name/Spelling Changes
--------------------------
spread out words across the phonological space more evenly; reduce similar-sounding wordgroups:
    ijo/ilo
    poki/poka
    ko/kon
    kala/kalama/kama
    nasa/nasin
    pan/pana
    selo/seli/sewi/suli/suwi
replace sina -> si
replace namako, sin -> nawa
replace false friend sitelen (means drawing/writing, not website) -> tesen 
    (from french 'dessin', but with a harmonised second vowel)
shorten kepeken

### Phonic Space

I am not going to change the phonology;
I don't know enough about linguistic typology to choose new sounds (or new phonotactic rules)
that are as easy for all humans to pronounce.

Instead, I merely use the raw material given to me by Toki Pona's phonology and phonotactics,
to construct new words.

But in order to use that raw material, I need to know exactly what I have.
So let's work out the possible sounds in Toki Pona.

9 consonants (j k l m n p s t w)
5 vowels (a e i o u)

5 lone-vowel syllables: a e i o u

41 CV syllable words, minus 4 disallowed sounds (ji, ti, wo, and wu)

41 more CVn syllables

dual-syllable words:

"Toki Pona's syllables all follow a pattern: consonant + vowel + optional n. 
If a syllable is at the beginning of a word, the consonant is optional
(For example, ali and unpa don't begin with consonants).
The optional n is forbidden if the next syllable begins with m or n."

These rules produce over 6000 potential dual-syllable words;
so why does Toki Pona (a language with ~120 words) even HAVE 3-syllable words?

new rules: should all vowels in a word harmonise?
should we remove all consonant clusters? (nanpa, unpa, tenpo, monsi, linja)

Discarded Ideas
---------------

* colour, -coloured (so you can describe a colour using comparisons to other things)
    - there is already the word 'kule' which can be used as above
* new word for get/take/receive 'mete' -- instead use passivity marker with give
    - although this prevents us from using 'mete ike' as 'stealing'
* stone/ball/egg/round
    - found: sike=     circle, wheel, sphere, ball, cycle, round, cyclical
