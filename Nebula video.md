# Nebula Video: Why I Don't Want to Support Another Platofmr's Rise to Power


I've only recently discovered the existence of Nebula (29 February, from a cross-promo with Curiosity Stream in a popular video by PolyMatter. Hope that helps your Market Research, if you do that!).

My guess is you're still working out bugs in the platform, so you're in semi-stealth (or at least haven't formally LAUNCHED) while early adopters provide feedback/beta test it, while you develop the most-requested features. Nothing wrong with that, as long as you let your users know that *that's* what they're doing.

At first I was excited, because I really like the idea of a place I can be Given This Day My Daily Breadtube (Amen /s) without having to wade through crowds of Big Brain fragile male egos screeching about topics they don't fully understand, as I do on YouTube.

I've been regularly watching videos on YouTube for about 12 years and over that time, it's become an increasingly defensive experience to just Watch Some Choob. A few years ago, I started maintaining my own custom [uBlock Origin blocking rules list](https://github.com/medavox/uor/blob/master/ytbs.txt) (originally inspired by [Hbomberguy's YouTube Censorship addon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN0REjUCGlE)) specifically to hide as much right-wing YouTube content as possible. But even so I've felt less and less able to trust a random video to take me on an interesting journey, rather than try to radicalise me.

So a place where this defensiveness became less necessary is great.

I disagree with the Sponsored Video model. I think it subtly influences what videos creators can make, and what they're allowed to say in those videos, in ways that are hard to detect for viewers like me.

I wish I could get behind another independent platform.

But despite all the good stuff your videographers (I hate the term Content Creators) create, **you are still another corporate, centrally-owned platform**, with all the potential for eventual misbehaviour that entails. Oliver Thorn talks about the difference between [making money from doing things, and from owning things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYkLVU5UGM8&t=20m20s). I think Nebula is aiming to join the latter camp.

So if I did buy in (financially and mentally) to Nebula, what is likely to happen in, say, 2 to 5 years?

# Scenario 1: Our Incredible Journey

What's to say you're not aiming to get bought up by a big tech conglomerate? You don't even have to be expressly aiming for this right now (or at least not detectably to your users), but the assumption in the tech industry is **anything can be bought for enough money**, and they have enough money. And if the carrot doesn't work, there's always the stick: they always have the money for litigation, smear campaigns and general harassment.

I don't even know if it exists anymore, but there's a great tumblr called [Our Incredible Journey](https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com/) that documents all the companies whose value has been built by enthusiastic users filling them with lists and photos and their lives basically, until a huge Multinational tech corporation SWOOPs in, buys it, and shuts it down. It demonstrates my fatigue with all these small innovative companies I want to succeed and then support, being bought and shut down by much bigger companies. I'm finished with investing myself (my time, and emotionally) into anything else that this could happen to.

After Tumblr's company culture and net activism was systematically crushed by diametrically-opposed Verizon buying it as punishment for fighting for net-neutrality, I realised there is literally no point in supporting ANY organisation (no matter what they look like and their politics) which is vulnerable to this kind of attack. What did the Yuppies in the 80s call it? Hostile Takeover.

And there's already signs that the management of Nebula gels well enough with Corporatistic ideologies that they wouldn't be adverse to being bought. Hey, as long as you get rich, right? Who cares what YouTube (or Netflix or whoever) does with Nebula after they buy it?

If all my subscription money ultimately ends up back in the hands of companies I supported Nebula in order to get away from, I can't support this.

# Scenario 2: Founders and IPOs

Even if a good-case scenario happens and Nebula does get big on its own, it could end up like Patreon. I used to love watching Pomplamoose's VideoSongs; but now my heart's just not in it (say corkfish in replies if you read this whole thing). It feels like applauding the King for winning the Tournament. Their success is, overall, a Good Thing and I'm happy for them, but 1) it gets harder and harder to identify with videographers the more and more privileged (and less like me) they become, and 2) Patreon has done some well-documented shitty things over the last few years.

I really REALLY want there to be SOME kind of community hub that breadtubers et al can congregate around; I actually agree with Gutian's point in the [Open Letter To Big Breadtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH35lLKm4VI&t=2m20s), that there should be a Unified Breadtube discord (or better chatroom software).

# Scenario 3: Failure

This is, of course, the most likely scenario for most startups. But I'm not going to talk about it much, because frankly it's not very interesting, and preventing it is more of a Business Development problem than wider systemic one. The money runs out, funding falls through, it fails to attract enough users, etc etc.

# Scenario 4: A Better Alternative to All This

This isn't just an aimless rant that I don't like your company or whatever; I really like what you're trying to do, and if the service becomes usable for me (in the UK) I might actually sign up for that Curiosity Stream/Nebula corporate affiliation that all you lovely breadtubers are pushing at us users for some presumed cash benefit! :)

I'm posting because *there is already an alternative model*: PeerTube.

You might have heard of it. You might be thinking, "oh great, another Free Speech platform for hosting the very worst of human thought, too vile even for youtube".
But it's not that.

It's a federated platform ,which means you run your own instance. the platform itself is open-source, which means you (or developers you hire!) can add features you want.
You don't have to show videos from other instances if you don't want, if they start getting fascy.

It's a decentralised video hosting service.
