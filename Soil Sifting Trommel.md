wheels diameter = just under 580mm
(22" wheels)
calculated wheel circumference = 1822mm


MESH:
holes on best existing handpan are 5mm
UK Here We Grow's design (using 2 wheels) has a cylinder length of 1000mm

a 1.9m by 1m sheet should cost between £44 and £72

The design should be motorised - otherwise it would require 2 people to operate (which is inconvenient),
or 1 person switching tasks, which is slow

however, a motor isn't a prerequisite, so we can try it out by hand,
to see if it's useful.

The choices are either:

* Mains AC electric motor 0.5HP/370W 1-3kRPM
    - this is what the YouTubers use
* 12V DC motor
    - allows us to use a leisure battery to power it
