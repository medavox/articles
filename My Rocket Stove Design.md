My Rocket Stove Design
==========

Requirements
------

* __Cleanable__:Removable ash pan. Or at least a way to sweep ash out
* vermiculite/perlite insulation around central chimney
* small vertical drop for embers to sit in, so they don't block the draught
* vermiculite insulation is sealed, to prevent powdery mess

* *Maybe?* u-bend at top of main chimney, so smoke is sealed away from cooking surface. 
    - You cook instead on the top of u-bend
