Non-Industry Games ("Nondy")
======

* Day 1 mod API
	- mods are required (by license agreement) to be open-source, allowing other players to pick up the torch of abandoned but popular mods
* NO LOOTBOXES
* Early access release only when all game mechanics have been completed
	- another way of saying it: no new game-changing mechanics will be implemented after EA release
* DLCs:
	- expansion packs may be released, capped at <50% the cost of the base game each
* Weekly polls (with something like uservoice.com) about what development to prioritise
	- which features/bugfixes/optimisations 
* restrictions on early access
	- Current price is proportional to the amount the game is finished
	- no working on or releasing DLC until the base game is finished
	- time in EA
	- if game development becomes abandoned before completion, the source code is released into the public domain
	
Another Idea:

* Open Source 
* Source code is free
* built binaries are not
* all third-party built binaries must carry the following marker to indicate its third-party status: UNOFFICIAL
* patches are welcomed



* further development is 50% controlled by a public queue of work in progress;
* the other 50% is decided in-house)
* users may buy votes with real money to influence future development
* earlier work is completed first (or else if not completable, finished or ended in some way);
* the next piece of work is chosen from a pool of suggestions, 
    * with the piece of work having the highest number of votes winning
