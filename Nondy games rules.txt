Non-Industry ("Nondy") games organisation structure rules,
maybe applicable more widely:

* further development is 50% controlled by a public queue of work in progress;
* the other 50% is decided in-house
    - developers do have a right to a say over what they'll spend their day working on,
    - but users also deserve a say in how a product/project they care about is developed
    - each in-house team member gets a vote
    - however many public votes are counted, the total weighting of public vs private is made the same.
    - so for 10 in-house votes vs 1000 public votes,
      each in-house vote is scaled to be worth 100 public votes
    - no reverse de-scaling is done if there are more in-house votes than public votes
      (prevents a small audience wielding too much power over the team)
* users may buy votes with real money to influence future development
    - one vote per bank account per (day/week/month/decision/whatever),
      to prevent undue influence by the rich
    - possibly a minimum vote cost, with no upper limit
    - possibly scale vote cost according ot originating country
* earlier work is completed first (or else if not completable, finished or ended in some way);
* the next piece of work is chosen from a pool of suggestions, 
    * with the piece of work having the highest number of votes winning
* the public have the right to veto development of something,
  if there is a public >= 75% majority on vetoing it
* the dev team have the right to veto an idea;
  how the dev team decide to exercise their veto power is left open
