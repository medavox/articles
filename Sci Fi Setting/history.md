There used to be warp drive, and humans colonised the entire galaxy.

But at some point in the distant past, there was a highly destructive war against AI,
and the laws of physics were permanently changed so that this form of FTL travel no longer works.

The universe is our universe, and the laws of physics are our laws (give or take a few bits of artistic license ot make the FTL work), but they used to be different.

Only now, thousands of years later, is your civilisation finally reaching out to the stars again, which yu think is for the first time.

You think you're on Earth, but your world is actually one of these colonies, that is so ancient it forgot it's a colony, and thought it's the original homeworld.

This planet is our Earth, but it's not the original homeworld (which was the first planet to be called Earth).

Not all of this is known to the protagonist civ. 


My Star Trek redo setting:
The twist is, it's not earth!
It's a collapsed colony that rebuilt, but forgot it wasn't.
It's actually the far future, and on earth (which will appear later) raccoons have evolved intelligence

Btw a dream i had was that different a alien s overwhelm parallel earths with different elemental things, slime water
