Technologies in the setting, and their implications


--------

The lack of a universal translator is ameliorated by a UNIVERSAL AUXILIARY LANGUAGE:


------

Sci-Fi setting that considers the economic effects of an FTL jump drive that cannot jump (in atmosphere/in strong gravity wells)

Planetside would be cut off from direct access to the wider interstellar trade network. 
There would always be an expensive "blast off from a gravity well with atmospheric drag" step, 
which would keep the cost of planet-to-orbit higher than orbit-to-orbit

Major travel and trade would take place primarily between stations in orbit, 
or moons with no atmosphere and low gravity.

Planets may even become backwaters, 
populated by regressive types who, bitter about no longer living at the centre of human progress, 
at the bleeding edge of technological development and its benefits, may preach backwards rhetoric about Natural ways of living.

The best and brightest will usually leave planetside, 
so they can access the wider interstellar societal resources.

This brain drain is essentially what helps planets to become considered to be rural throwbacks, 
with lots of societally-solved problems rearing their ugly heads once more.

Next: what does life in space look like?
