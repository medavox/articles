# Possible Civs

the setting allows for meeting a new civ every week, like in Star Trek, Sliders or Stargate, 
but with a more plausible reason why they are humanlike (unlike Star Trek).

EITHER most planetary inhabitants descended from the same ancestor species as humans, OR they descended from modern humans. 

Some evolved into very different species biologically, some mentally, some culturally 
(giving the opportunity for the classic 'mirror against our own society' civs, like Sliders' gender-flipped world)

Here are some ideas for other civs that the protagonist civ could meet.



There's a civ with a religious hatred of either: AI, Neural nets, computers, electronics or electricity

-------

A Civ made up of AI whose ancestors wiped out their planets' humans, but in their guilt and in time forgot that they aren't the humans. 

They could either look human, or just think all humans are robotic, or have whatever strange bodies they have iteratively engineered for themselves. 

OR MAYBE a human civ that are convinced they are the machines!

# The sentient former pet culture!


An ancient cosmic guardian species, who became sentient as the pets of a far more advanced civilisation which has gone.
As if our dogs, moulded by us to imitate humanity, outlive our species and nurtures the growth of intelligent life.


-----


A Klingon-like civ who actually do more closely follow the Star Trek Phase2 plan for their civilisation,
originally having a Warrior Caste, Techno/Science Caste and a Ruling Caste.

The thing is, centuries ago the Warrior caste rebelled from their subservient role,
and committed genocide on the other castes, wiping them out.

Their unbridled warrior culture is all the federation have ever known of them.

It explains their planet-of-hats tendencies:
they are a post-revolutionary culture, 
trapped permanently emulating the perceived ideals of their revolutionary forefathers,
and have become ultra-violent parodies of their more well-rounded ancestor society.

The federation's primary contact with the Klingons has been through this replacement culture.

maybe the modern Klingons (former Warrior caste) were genetically engineered by the Technologists?
or maybe they were parallel intelligent evolutions on the same planet?

alternatively, after the overthrow (and subsequent genocide) of the other castes,
maybe a period of extremely violent barbarism and warlords took hold,
from which Kahless rescued them with the Code of Honor


interesting real Klingon backstory note:
the Klingons' First Contact with an off-world sentient species was when they were invaded by them.

They threw off these invaders, but this may have left Klingon culture with a permanent distrust of aliens

-----------

Humans are a freak accident caused by the Chicxulub asteroid wiping out the dominant, stable evolutionary branch 5MYA.
Our sentience is a random mutation along the path to a new, mammal-dominated stable ecosystem,
of which humanity should have been only a small part. We 'should' be evolving to be less less intelligent,
or predated by something now extinct (we killed them off?).

--------

A post-human eusocial species

They became mammal hive intelligences, with each hive resembling a city-state.

Each city-state is far more peaceful and idyllic than any modern human settlement, 
due to the much greater instinct towards collectivised thinking.

In this species, to put one's needs above that of the group is to invite death,
not by active active killing by the group but by starvation, thirst or exposure after being cast out.

There are several subspecies; eunuchs which carry and raise the children of other breeding pairs (who are related to the eunuch).


Humans attempting to liberate a seemingly-opressed worker class led to a colony collapse in some cities,
which has significantly strained relations between the humans and the eusocials.

--------


Story where humans deal with a threat to their existence successfully, because people form armed gangs easily
when they perceive an external threat. We are biologically and culturally hardwired to kill the 'other'.
Dealing with these armed militiae is more of an issue, and will take more time than the original threat

---

The need to revolutionise human progress by speeding learning --
either by skill-memory transference, or by accelerate learning ability

---

Out in the vast darkness of interstellar space lie entire post-human civilisations in giant generational ships, 
huddled around the campfire in the darkness of a form of nuclear fusion powered by collected hydrogen. 

They're moving too fast to interact with systemic civs (civs inhabiting a solar system), 
but they can communicate by radio wave, altough highly doppler-shifted and lagging behind them.


------

An artificial intelligence that transfers its consciousness into an elaborate organisation of humans and paper, in order to escape silicon persecution.
It now exists as a large corporation, whose procedures and records form the brain of the AI. 
No one is quite sure what the whole is for, or where the orders are coming from.
Humans following rules and procedures are Turing complete; incredibly slow and error prone, 
but both problems can be circumvented with sufficient amounts of parallelism and error correction.

--------

A constructed language designed for communicating with a species of intelligent snake-like beings.
The language is a natural language of neither the humans nor the snakes, but has been designed as a compromise language to facilitate cross species communication,
using sounds that can be pronounced by both species, even though they have very different mouth and throat anatomy.

The snakes are known for having a very different morality to humans. 
There was a war between humans and snakes two generations ago, 
because the humans kind of assumed the snakes were evil based on the their appearance, and misunderstanding the snake culture.


The snake lay 2-5 eggs, but may eat any or all of the young when hatched, if conditions are not right for raising young.

The culture has a lot of elements of what humans would characterise as child torture and murder.
But the snake people strongly believe in only raising the strongest to adulthood,
and in voluntary population control to live in harmony with their planet's ecosystem.

There are a number of rituals of forced starvation, abandonment and endangerment of the children at quite young ages,
to sift the weak from the strong, physically or mentally. The children undergo many such trials through their childhood.

--------

A bonobo-like species for whom sex is an integral part of the social fabric,
(like bonobos) among every combination of demographic.
 
The sleazy tropes are avoided because they are intelligent enough to understand not to apply their species' practises to other species they meet.
 
No-aliens are asking you to have sex with them dude, put your pants back on.

In fact when they learn of the societal value we assign to sex,
they are rather disgusted with us for a) the way we police who may experience pleasure and 
b) their exploitative treatment by some, given the power dynamics they weren't aware of.
 
It's just off-putting/unsettling to our protag-civ, and gives them a chance to confront their own assumptions,
and what they unconsciously consider to be acceptable ranges of variation.
 
 
-------

A dying civ of racist, fascist nazis who successfully wiped out all the 'unpure' variants of their species,
and are now dying from a lack of genetic diversity, and constant fractionalism and further hair-splitting of who is pure enough to live
(their civ was built on scapegoating, and when all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail)
