Sometimes, others can see our problems better than we can.
It's kind to point out ketchup on someone else's face,
because they can't see it, and can wipe it away once they know.

It's cruel to point out someone's big nose or scar or hair loss,
because they already know about it, and they can't change it.
You're only reminding them of an upsetting part of themselves
